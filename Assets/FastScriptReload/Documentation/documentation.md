# Fast/Live Script Reload

Tool will allow you to iterate quicker on your code. You simply go into play mode, make a change to any file and it'll be compiled on the fly and hot-reloaded in your running play-mode session.

## Getting started
1) Import
2) Welcome screen will open - it contains all needed info to get started as well as support links and configuration.
`You can always get back to this screen via 'Window -> Fast/Live Script Reload -> Start Screen'`
3) Go to Launch Demo -> Basic Example window
4) Follow instructions listed there

```
Example scene 'Point' material should automatically detect URP or surface shader
If it shows pink, please adjust by picking shader manually:
1) URP: 'Shader Graphs/Point URP'
2) Surface: 'Graph/Point Surface'
```

## On-Device Hot-Reload (Live Script reload)
There's an addon to this tool - Live Script Reload - that'll allow you to use same functionality over the network in device build, eg:
- android (including VR headsets like Quest 2)
- standalone windows

[Find more details here](https://immersivevrtools.com/redirect/fast-script-reload/live-script-reload-extension)

**Live Script Reload is using Fast Script Reload as a base asset - documentation is combined, if you don't use Live Script Reload you can skip any sections in this document prefixed with [Live-Reload]**

## Reporting Compilation Errors
I've put lots of effort to test various code patterns in various codebases. Still - it's possible you'll find some instances where code would not compile, it's easiest to:
1) Look at compiler error and compare with generated source code, usually it'll be very obvious why issue is occuring
2) Refactor problematic part (look at limitations section as they'll explain how)
3) Let me know via support email and I'll get it fixed

## Executing custom code on hot reload
Custom code can be executed on hot reload by adding a method to changed script.

**You can see example by adjusting code in 'Graph.cs' file.**

```
    void OnScriptHotReload()
    {
        //do whatever you want to do with access to instance via 'this'
    }
```

```
    static void OnScriptHotReloadNoInstance()
    {
       //do whatever you want to do without instance
       //useful if you've added brand new type
       // or want to simply execute some code without |any instance created.
       //Like reload scene, call test function etc
    }
```

## Options
```
Context menus will be prefixed with used version, either Fast Script Reload or Live Script Reload.
```

You can access Welcome Screen / Options via 'Window -> Fast/Live Script Reload -> Start Screen' - it contains useful information as well as options.

```
Options can aslo be accessed via 'Edit -> Preferences -> Fast/Live Script Reload'
```

### Auto Hot-Reload
By default tool will pick changes made to any file in playmode. You can add exclusions to that behaviour, more on that later.

You can also manually manage reload, to do so:
1) Un-tick 'Enable auto Hot-Reload for changed files' in Options -> Reload page
2) Click Window -> Fast Script Reload -> Force Reload to trigger
3) or call `FastScriptReloadManager.TriggerReloadForChangedFiles()` method from code

### [Live-Reload] Hot-Reload over Network
With on-device build, your code changes will be distributed over the network in real-time.

By default running application will send a broadcast and try to discover editor running the tool. 

Broadcast is initiated from device where build is running on (not from editor) - this means device running editor needs to allow the connection.

### [Live-Reload] Troubleshooting network issues
If for whatever reason reload over network doesn't work, please:

1) go to 'Window -> Live Script Reload -> Options/Network'
2) make sure port used is not already used by any other application
3) make sure your Firewall allows connections on that port
4) If you think broadcast doesn't work in your network it's best to specify IP Address explicitly (tick 'Force specific UP address for clients to receive Hot-Reload updates' and add IP)
   - this will allow client (build on device) connect directly to specified address

### [Live-Reload] Connected Client
In playmode, message will be logged when clients connects. Also Options/Network will display connected client, eg Android phone could be identified as:

`SM-100232 connected from 192.189.168.68:12548`

**Only 1 client can be connected at any time.**

### [Live-Reload] Testing with Editor
By default, editor will reflect any changes you made without using network. If you want to force editor to behave as networked client:
1) Press play
2) Find DontDestroyOnLoadObject 'NetworkedAssemblyChangesLoader' - 
3) tick 'IsDebug'
4) tick 'Editor Acts as Remote Client'
5) enable NetworkedAssemblyChangesLoader component

### Managing file exclusions
Files can be excluded from auto-compilation.

#### via 'Project' context menu
1) Right click on any *.cs file
2) Click Fast Script Reload
3) Add Hot-Reload Exclusion

*You can remove exclusion from same menu*

#### via Exclusions page
To view all exclusions:
1) Right click on any *.cs file
2) Click Fast Script Reload
3) Click Show Exclusions

#### via class attribute
You can also add `[PreventHotReload]` attribute to a class to prevent hot reload for that class.

### Batch script changes and reload every N seconds
Script will batch all your playmode changes and Hot-Reload them in bulk every 3 seconds - you can change duration from 'Reload' options page.

## Production Build
For Fast Script Reload asset code will be excluded from any builds.

For Live Script Reload you should exclude it from final production build, do that via:
- 'Window -> Fast Script Reload -> Welcome Screen -> Build -> Enable Hot Reload For Build' - untick
 
**When building via File -> Build Settings - you'll also see Live Script Reload status under 'Build' button. You can click 'Adjust' button which will take you to build page for asset.**
```This is designed to make sure you don't accidentally build tool into release althoguh best approach would be to ensure your release process takes care of that.```

## Performance

Your app performance won't be affected in any meaningful way.
Biggest bit is additional memory used for your re-compiled code.
Won't be visible unless you make 100s of changes in same play-session.

## LIMITATIONS (please make sure to read those)
There are some limitation due to the approach taken to Hot-Reload your scripts. I've tried to minimise the impact to standard dev-workflow as much as possible.

In some cases however you may need to use workarounds as described below.

### Breakpoints in hot-reloaded scripts won't be hit, sorry!

- only for the scripts you changed, others will work
- with how quick it compiles and reloads you may not even need a debugger

### Generic methods and classes won't be Hot-Reloaded
Unfortunately generics will not be Hot-Reloaded, to workaround you'd need to move code to non-generic class / method.

Tool will try to change non-generic methods in those files and will simply skip generic ones.

*Note - you can still Hot-Reload for class implementations that derive from generic base class but are not generic themselves, eg.*
```

class SingletonImplementation: SingletonBase<SomeConcreteType> {
   public void SomeSpecificFunctionality() {
      //you can change code here and it'll be Hot-Reloaded as type itself is not generic
   }
   
   public void GenericMethod<T>(T arg) {
      //changes here won't be Hot-Reloaded as method is generic
   }
}

class SingletonBase<T> where T: new() {
   public T Instance;
   
   public void Init() {
      Instance = new T(); //if you change this code it won't be Hot-Reloaded as it's in generic type
   }
}

```

### Passing `this` reference to method that expect concrete class implementation

`**By default experimental setting 'Enable method calls with 'this' as argument fix' is turned on in options, and should fix 'this' calls/assignment issue.
If you see issues with that please turn setting off and get in touch via support email.**

Unless experimental setting is on - it'll throw compilation error `The best overloaded method match for xxx has some invalid arguments` - this is due to the fact that changed code is technically different type.
The code will need to be adjusted to depend on some abstraction instead (before hot-reload).

This code would cause the above error.
```
public class EnemyController: MonoBehaviour { 
    EnemyManager m_EnemyManager;

    void Start()
    {
        //calling 'this' causes issues as after hot-reload the type of EnemyController will change to 'EnemyController__Patched_'
        m_EnemyManager.RegisterEnemy(this);
    }
}

public class EnemyManager : MonoBehaviour {
    public void RegisterEnemy(EnemyController enemy) { //RegisterEnemy method expects parameter of concrete type (EnemyController) 
        //impementation
    }
}
```

It could be changed to support Hot-Reload in following way:

1) Don't depend on concrete implementations, instead use interfaces/abstraction
```
public class EnemyController: MonoBehaviour, IRegistrableEnemy { 
    EnemyManager m_EnemyManager;

    void Start()
    {
        //calling this causes issues as after hot-reload the type of EnemyController will change
        m_EnemyManager.RegisterEnemy(this);
    }
}

public class EnemyManager : MonoBehaviour {
    public void RegisterEnemy(IRegistrableEnemy enemy) { //Using interface will go around error
        //impementation
    }
}

public interface IRegistrableEnemy
{
    //implementation
}
```

2) Adjust method param to have common base class
```
public class EnemyManager : MonoBehaviour {
    public void RegisterEnemy(MonoBehaviour enemy) { //Using common MonoBehaviour will go around error
        //impementation
    }
}
```

### Assigning `this` to a field references
Similar as above, this could cause some trouble although 'Enable method calls with 'this' as argument fix' setting will fix most of the issues. 

Especially visible with singletons.
eg.

```
public class MySingleton: MonoBehaviour {
    public static MySingleton Instance;
    
    void Start() {
        Instance = this;
    }
}
```

### Extensive use of nested classed / structs
If your code-base contains lots of nested classes - you may see more compilation errors.

Easy workaround is to move those nested classes away so they are top-level.

### Creating new public methods
Hot-reload for new methods will only work with private methods (only called by changed code).

### Adding new fields
Adding new fields is not supported in play mode.
You can however simply create local variable and later quickly refactor that out.

eg. for a simple class that moves position by some vector on every update

*Initial class before play mode entered*
```
public class SimpleTransformMover: MonoBehaviour {
   void Update() {
        transform.position += new Vector3(1, 0, 0);
    }
}
```

*Changes in playmode*
```
public class SimpleTransformMover: MonoBehaviour {
   //public Vector3 _moveBy = new Vector3(1, 0, 0); //1) do not introduce fields in play mode
    
   void Update() {
        var _moveBy = new Vector3(1, 0, 0); //2) instead declare variable in method scope 
        // (optionally with instance scope name-convention)
   
        // transform.position += new Vector3(1, 0, 0); //original code - now will use variable
        transform.position += _moveBy; //3) changed code - uses local variable
        
        4) iterate as needed and after play mode simply refactor added variables as fields
    }
}
```

*Tool will show error if you try to add/remove fields and won't perform Hot-Reload.*

### No IL2CPP support
Asset runs based on specific .NET functionality, IL2CPP builds will not be supported. Although as this is development workflow aid you can build your APK with Mono backend (android) and change later.

### Windows only
Tool is unlikely to run outside of windows OS.

### Adding new references
When you're trying to reference new code in play-mode session that'll fail if assembly is not yet referencing that (most often happens when using AsmDefs that are not yet referencing each other)

## Roadmap
- add debugger support for hot-reloaded scripts
- better compiler support to work around limitations
